# snapcup

## Setup repository

After downloading the repository please run

```bash
npm run install:all
```

This will install the top level npm packages as well as the npm packages for `app/` and `functions/`

and if you are working in a linux environment please then run

```bash
npm run gitsetup
```

to make the pre-commit hook executable

## Environment Variables

To run locally with your own backend, add a `.env.local` file to `app/` with your own firebase credential variables.

Then, `cd` into `app/` and run

```bash
npm start
```

to run the front end React app.

## Testing

Run `npm test` from `app/` to run all test suites. To enter watch mode for all test suites, type `npm test -- --watch` for automatic re-running of tests upon saving.
To run a single test suite, run `npm test <file>` with optional `-- --watch`, e.g. `npm test sum -- --watch`.

## Enabling complex sorting and filtering on Firestore

In order to be able to chain the filter and sort needed to get a user's snaps and sort by date, navigate to your firestore console and add a index with collection id `snaps`, fields indexed `from: Ascending` `timestamp: Descending` and query scope `Collection`.

## CSS variables

In app.scss bootstrap variables are customised, and a few global CSS variables are set. It is recommended to use `font-family: var(--open-sans);` and `font-family: var(--asap)` to use those fonts as required. Also it is recommended to use `var(--purple-selected)`, `var(--purple-hover)` and `var(--our-grey)` as colors as needed. Finally, `purple` has been added as a theme color to bootstrap allowing code like

```html
<button class="btn btn-purple">Nicely formatted button!</button>
```

## How to use the Firebase Emulator

To use the firebase emulator simply run

```bash
firebase emulators:start
```

from the root directory. This allows you to open the firebase emulator console and it mocks firestore, auth and firebase functions from your directory.

**Every time** you start the emulator you should go to the auth tab and add a test account, with credentials

```
username: test@test.com
password: testtest
```

### JDK

The command will fail if you do not have the Java JDK installed, however the command will give you a link to openjdk, from where you can download it.

On windows you can install a zip file with the JDK, unzip it to C:/jdk-16, and then add C:/jdk-16/bin to the global path variable.

In wsl/ubuntu, you can just run `sudo apt update` and then `sudo apt install default-jdk` and this will install the jdk for you.

### Linking React app to emulator

To start the app and use the emulator instead of the normal remote Firebase servers, `cd` into `app/` and run

```bash
npm run start:withfirebase
```

When you click the log on button you will automatically log in with the test@test.com account instead of using OAuth.
