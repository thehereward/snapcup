# Styling

## CSS variables

In app.scss bootstrap variables are customised, and a few global CSS variables are set. It is recommended to use `font-family: var(--open-sans);` and `font-family: var(--asap)` to use those fonts as required. Also it is recommended to use `var(--purple-selected)`, `var(--purple-hover)` and `var(--our-grey)` as colors as needed. Finally, `purple` has been added as a theme color to bootstrap allowing code like

```html
<button class="btn btn-purple">Nicely formatted button!</button>
```
