    - Collect a list of snappable people from firestore

    - user "displayTransform" to customise matched text <- make it blue 
    - 

Data Collection
    - Query all users that are snappable
        snappables = firebase.firestore().collection("users").where("isSnappable", "==", true).get()
        [names] = snappables.forEach(elem => elem.name)
(assume names are unique since it's only 40-50 people)

firebase
    - users
        - GetSnappables.ts  <- returns snappable users
